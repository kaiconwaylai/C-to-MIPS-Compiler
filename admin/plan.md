Changelog
---------
28/02/2021: Set up a lot of files for project, started planning AST, as well as parser + lexer. Current goal is to create a working compiler for the following code:
```
int main()
{
  return 2;
}
```
Not planning on adding any further constructs until the suitable AST framework has been established for this.
